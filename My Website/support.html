                    <p>Q: Why Star Lost?</p>
                    <p>A: Star Lost is an independent star registry, active since 2018, that gives you the opportunity to name your own star, which is then added to the star registry. Star Lost has named over 100,000 stars with excellent customer service and multiple partners.</p>
                    <p>Q: How long does shipping take?</p>
                    <p>A: Shipping is super fast, super secure and FREE! Orders are shipped as fast as possible 5 days a week via USPS. Email delivery takes as little as 2 minutes, although in some cases it can take up to 1 hour. Orders shipped outside of the USA vary in delivery time; UK, Europe and Australia are delivered within 1-5 business days; for the rest of the world, delivery is expected within 7-14 business days and is priced at $14.95. </p>
                    <p>Q: What can I name my star?</p>
                    <p>A: You can name your star anything you want with the exception of profanity or offensive remarks. We also recommend that you do not use offensive language in your personal message, as this may result in your order being canceled and a refund issued.</p>
                    <p>Q: How visible will my star be?</p>
                    <p>A: Star Lost only names stars that are clearly visible online and have a magnitude that ensures they can be found with a telescope.</p>
