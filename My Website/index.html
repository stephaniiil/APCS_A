                    <h4>Why buy a star?</h4>
                    <p>There are not many "eternal gifts" in our world, and among them, the beauty of starlight is in no way inferior to that of diamonds. They have been admired for millennia - people have been watching the stars since the dawn of civilization. Beautiful and bright, cold and inexhaustible, they are in many ways mysteries of the universe that will continue to inspire admiration and curiosity for many generations to come. As children, each of us looked to the stars for something we could not find on Earth. Finally, a philosopher asked the question: "Are we human because we look at the stars? Or do we look at the stars because we are human? ".</p>
                    <h4>Why dedicate a star to someone?</h4>
                    <p>These days it is really hard to surprise someone with an original gift. Every year we give each other the same old material possessions that often end up unwanted, damaged, or lost. Eventually, we lose interest in such gifts and they gather dust on shelves in homes around the world. Naming a star for someone you love is something that will always make them feel special. Their names will remain forever in the sky along with the pure light of the celestial bodies.</p>
